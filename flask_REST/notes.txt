Resourse, allows you to create a resource to connect to using the RESt api
API will be a wrapped around the app to allow the resourse to connect to. 

Resourse classes have different methonds like get, post, put and delete

So the api(app) wraps the app, 

inheriting Resourse will allow methods and create a resource for rest api to connect to, 

then assign/connect the resource to an url, 
api.add_resouse(Helloword, '/') 
this will add a resouse to api (which is wrapped around the app) to cinnect to a url '/'
