when a new column in added in the Model class, sql needs to know that changes.
this is called migrating.  
can be done in flask migrate

First have to set the Flask app environment variable. 

***set $env:FLASK_APP='myapp.py' for powershell

have to be in the same directory as file when running from cmd, or it;ll say cant find the file 

after settin the flask application, we can do following


flask db init -- which sets the migration directory
(this happens only first)
 
***python -m flask db init***

after making change to database,
flask db migrate -m 'message', sets the migration file
***python -m flask db migrate -m 'message',
flask db upgrade , updates the database with migration

error : sqlalchemy.exc.NoSuchModuleError: Can't load plugin: sqlalchemy.dialects:sqllite
typo : had typed sqllite with double LLs. fixed after.

error : outside context error when app.app_context().push() was not written.
